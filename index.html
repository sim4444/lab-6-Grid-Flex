                    <h3>Short Introduction About Me: </h3>
                    <p>My name is Simran and I am a Term 1 student. Getting admission in BCIT's CIT program is <strong><em>really</em></strong> a big achievement for me because BCIT has set <strong>very</strong> high standards of approving admission. I am enrolled in 7 courses right now and all the courses are <em><strong>highly</strong></em> effective in learning <em>useful</em> technical skills. My fellow classmates are <em>actually</em> helpful and always try to solve problems together to work as a team. I am having an <strong>amazing</strong> experience of learning skills and establishing <em>great</em> friendships with my peers. </p>
