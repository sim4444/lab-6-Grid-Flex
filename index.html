        <h1>Life Of A BCIT Student</h1>
        <h2>My Campus Life Experience</h2>
        <p>My name is Simran and I am a Term 1 student. Getting admission in BCIT's CIT program is <strong><em>really</em></strong> a big achievement for me because BCIT has set <strong>very</strong> high standards of approving admission. I am enrolled in 7 courses right now and all the courses are <em><strong>highly</strong></em> effective in learning <em>useful</em> technical skills. My fellow classmates are <em>actually</em> helpful and always try to solve problems together to work as a team. I am having an <strong>amazing</strong> experience of learning skills and establishing <em>great</em> friendships with my peers. Three of my <em><strong>top favourite</strong></em> courses are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Technical Maths for IT</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20231089205/" title="bcit website" target="_blank">Fundamental Web Technologies</a></li>
            <li>Scripting for IT</li>
        </ol>
